“The majority of the work that may be described as analytics occurring within either industry or within the various business units of higher educational institutions is actually high level descriptive statistics or predictive modelling, and, more recently, has advanced to what is described as prescriptive analytics, where, given some business process (we will generically use business process to contextualize our advancing discussion, but the process could fall within any domain), the leadership of a given entity would like to know what future actions should be taken given the various choices at hand coupled with their likelihood of occurring.
As a student of research methodology, I find myself asking where causation should and could fit into this picture and have become interested in soundly locating where along the continuum of inferences more robust than mere prediction, such as localized causation available via the Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), may find their place and be of utility. Given a hypothetical situation of interest, what added benefit, it any, may be gained by leadership / administration who wield inferences from RDD beyond those stemming merely from prediction? This is the central question I am ultimately interested in answering.”

This project is a de-identified RMarkdown summary of a proof-of-concept project estimating an RDD and subsequent discussion of the related benefits.
